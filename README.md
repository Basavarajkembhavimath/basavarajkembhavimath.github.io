## Machine learning

Hi im 'Basavaraj Kembhavimath' today i started my journey with machine learning course, at 29-feb-2020
today i learned about the ML and what are the advantages of ML and where where we are using this and 
what are the basics we should know before started ML,

###1.what is machine learning?
Mahine learning is an application of artificial intelligence Ai that provides systems the ability
to automatically learn improve from experience without being explicitly programmed

=>The process of machine learning begins with observations or data, such as examples,
direct experience,or instructions,in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the futere
 
###=>In the machine learning 3 major types are there
1.Supervised(labelled)
2.Unsupervised(No labelled)
3.Semi supervised
4.Reinforcement learning

I wanted to mention all the things here 
You should know these things... "Before started Machine Learning"
1.Mathamatics:
	-Statistics
	-Algebra
	-lenear Algebra
	-Matrix's
	-probabilities

2.Python:
	-Basic programming skills
	-Data structures:Strings,List,Tuple,Set,,Dictionary
	-read and write Data to Files
	-Libraries:Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib

3.Youtube channels
	-Edureka
	-Simplilearn
	-geeks for geeks


###=>These companies are using Machine learning
1.Facebook
2.google
3.Netflix
4.Online shopping: flipkart, Amazon,etc
5.Online bookings:Uber,Ola,Zomato,Swiggy
6.Etc,etc...

###=>Applications of machine learning
1.Google Maps
2.facial recognition
3.Tesla:self driving cars
4.Mole:robotic chef for kichen
5.Google translate
6.Kuka:robotics
7.etc,etc.......
