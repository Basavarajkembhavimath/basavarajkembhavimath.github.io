Ensemble learning

We know that the method of ensemble is nothing but combining the multiple modelse and coming up with the good result of model accuracy.

The combining technique is done by ensemble model there are several teqniques to comine the several models and come of with one final model.

So lets take a examle of of titanic dataset to understand well about the ensemble learning.

Lets start:
We have a dataset about the titanic 
lets assume we are finding which  
1. combining indivisual models results
2. taking the average r square values of each model
3. comparing the models based on the r square and the give the weighted based on the rank of indivisual models
4. combining the each result and taking the final result by average value mean value.
