# 1. Collect information for all Airplane crashes from 2000 to 2020

You might already have received a GitHub link to a csv file called "plane_crash_all.csv"

Access the data from this csv file and present its summary report :
- Number of data points [ or rows ]
- Number of features [ or columns ]
- First 10 entries in the dataset
- Last 10 entries in the dataset
- Datatypes of each column

df1 = pd.read_csv('plane_crash_all.csv')

#First 10 entries in the dataset 
df1

#Last 10 entries in the dataset
df1[10:]

#To know the shape of the data (In this data frame Rows = 746,columns = 4)
df1.shape

#To know the columns name in the data frame
df1.columns

#Datatypes of each column
df1.dtypes

df1.head()

df1 = df1.drop(['Unnamed: 0'], axis=1)

# 2. Clean the data and arrange it into a DataFrame that contains the following columns

- Day [ Day of the month ]
- Month
- Year
- Location
- Operator
- Aircraft Type
- Total Passengers
- Casualties
- Ground Casualties

Make sure each column contains data with its appropriate datatype.

- Do you see any trend ?
- Has airplane transportation become any safer over the last 20 years ?

# Data Analysis
### In this graph we can clearly visible that is highest no of crashes happend in the year of 2000 and 2003 only.
### Yearly wise the crashes rate is decreased.
### And also we can see 2000 to 2010 the No of crashes per year is more then 30.
### when we loking at the latest updates we can appricciate the air lines department.
### Highest no of crashes recorded at the year of 2000 when its comes to 2019,2020 its very less

# ECDF Analysis
#### In this graph we can see the clear data that is :
#### Most of the year plane crashed less then 50 times.
#### yearly wise Air Line departments are improved so much thats y plane crashes are reduced
#### last 20 years of data 2019,2020 are the safer over the 20 year.
